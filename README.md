Programming is hard, not my words, that's github copilot's quote.

## Features

Syntax highlighting

> Magnificient features, I bet most languages don't even have highlights that impressive!

## Extension Settings

There is literally zero configuration for now. But in case people don't read this, I'll try to make a fool of themselves using `tilde.chocolate` for chocolate mint syntax!

- `tilde.nuclearExplosion`: by default set to `true`. This cause a nuclear explosion if your code doesn't suceed in compiling, if you don't want this, change it to `false`.

> Warning : this option will be modified without notice in the future.

## Known Issues

Work flawlessly, hopefully.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Tilde vscode extension.
